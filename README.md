# Life Satisfaction Structural Equation Modeling Analysis

## Overview
This project investigates factors associated with life satisfaction across countries using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The analysis explores how economic, demographic, environmental, and social variables relate to latent constructs such as development and quality of life. Variables examined include GDP per capita, life expectancy, fertility rate, mortality rate, population size, CO₂ emissions, and political corruption.

The project was completed using R and R Markdown and demonstrates skills in multivariate data analysis, latent variable modeling, and statistical interpretation. It was developed as part of coursework at the University of St. Thomas.

## Installation Instructions
To run this project locally, you will need:

- R (version 4.x or newer)
- RStudio (recommended)

All packages required for running are in the code block at the top of the file.

## Usage Instructions

Open the .Rmd file in RStudio and click Knit to generate the analysis report in HTML or PDF format. The knitted output includes data preprocessing steps, model specification, parameter estimates, fit indices, and interpretation of results.
The analysis can be modified by adjusting model equations or variables directly in the R Markdown file. All results are reproducible by re-knitting the document.

## Methods

This project applies Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to examine relationships between observed variables and latent constructs. Confirmatory factor analysis is used to define latent variables, followed by structural modeling to test hypothesized relationships. Model fit is evaluated using standard SEM fit indices, including chi-square, CFI, TLI, RMSEA, and SRMR.

## Project Context

This project was completed as part of my academic work in data science and statistics at the University of St. Thomas. It reflects an emphasis on rigorous quantitative reasoning, ethical use of data, and clear communication of analytical results. The project aligns with the university’s mission by applying statistical methods to socially relevant questions related to well-being and quality of life.
